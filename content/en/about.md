---

Hello! I am **Rui Lopes**, a Computer Science and Engineering student.

My technological journey began very early, driven by a natural passion for computers and a curiosity to understand how software shapes the world. What started as an interest in hardware and gaming evolved into a desire to build my own solutions.

### What I Bring
My core focus is software development, but my perspective is enriched by an academic background in **Economics**. This combination allows me to approach technical problems with an analytical perspective, focused on efficiency and system viability.

### Off-screen
To maintain balance and focus, I dedicate my time to:

- **Sports:** Fundamental to my discipline and ability to commit.
- **Gaming:** Where I developed my logical reasoning and quick decision-making skills.
- **Pets:** A personal passion that accompanies me in my daily life.
- **Economics and Markets:** A continuous interest that keeps my critical thinking sharp.
