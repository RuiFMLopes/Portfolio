### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### Professional Portfolio Website
This is my first step in building my **Digital Identity**. I decided not to use a visual website builder, but rather an engineering-focused approach.

**Technologies:**&nbsp;Hugo (Static Site Generator), TOML, Markdown and Git.

**Technical Highlights:** Customization of HTML/Go Templates and implementation of a multilingual interface (PT/EN) and Dark/Light mode switch.

**Objective:** To provide a professional technical touchpoint for recruiters and project partners.
